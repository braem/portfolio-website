Welcome to my website!
Here I put everything that interests me, which is a lot!
I'm an interdisciplinary researcher and a MSc. Candidate in Computer Science working in the field of automated music composition.
My interest in music comes from over a decade of playing classical guitar, some bass guitar, and very recently piano.
I also have been creating playable maps for years with Valve's Hammer Tool.

I post all of my creations here &mdash; and I suppose my algorithm's creations as well ;p.
