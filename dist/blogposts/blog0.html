  Welcome to my website!
  Here I put everything that interests me, which is a lot.
</p>
<p>
  First and formost I am a game developer for the open source project Momentum Mod.
  It is a video game aiming to centralize the many forms of source movement speedrunning, such as surf, bhop, rocket jump, and much more!
  See the website, steam store page, and Discord link in the links :)

  To satisfy my level design itch, I make maps for both Momentum Mod and Team Fortress 2 using Valve's Hammer tool.
  See the mapping section of the website to see the many maps I have created.

  Lastly, I used to be an interdisciplinary researcher and a MSc. Candidate in Computer Science working in the field of automated music composition.
  My interest in music comes from over a decade of playing classical guitar, some bass guitar, and very recently piano.
  I have since abandoned my academic career to focus on making video games. Priorities ;)
